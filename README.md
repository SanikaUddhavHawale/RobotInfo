For the development of the frontend, base, and landing page, a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript was utilized. HTML provided the structure of the webpage, while CSS and Bootstrap were employed for styling and layout purposes, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design. JavaScript was leveraged to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage, enhancing user experience.
On the backend, MySQL, PHP, and XAMPP server were employed to handle data management and server-side logic. MySQL served as the relational database management system, storing and organizing the data. PHP facilitated server-side scripting, enabling dynamic content generation and interaction with the database. XAMPP server provided a local development environment, encompassing Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, facilitating the setup and testing of the backend components.
Additionally, for user validation functionalities such as login and registration, the same stack of MySQL, PHP, and XAMPP server was utilized. PHP scripts were responsible for processing user inputs, validating credentials, and interacting with the database to authenticate users and manage user data securely.
Together, this stack of technologies facilitated the development of a comprehensive web application with both frontend and backend functionalities, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.
JavaScript, specifically utilizing the Battery Status API and ID3.js, dynamically updates the battery information in real-time. The script listens for changes in battery level and charging status, updating the displayed information accordingly. It also features a tooltip for detailed battery information and handles errors and unsupported browsers gracefully. The battery status is periodically checked and updated every 5 seconds to ensure accuracy.
